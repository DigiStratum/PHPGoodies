# PHPGoodies

Within is a collection of PHP Goodies that are general purpose, but which I use on nearly every new project. There are obviously many, many choices out there for PHP class libraries, but over the years I have crafted my own which has given me a deeper understanding of the PHP language, its capabilities, common pit-falls, and best practices. This experience has been invaluable for me personally as it has made me a better developer, and ultimately saves me time for each future project that reuses one of these implementations that I know intimately.

Now I make these implementations available to the general public in the hopes that others will benefit as well from studying my approach and by saving time on implementing something similar on their own (not that I discourage that since, as I mentioned, I find that to be a valuable exercise). Each class/library will have its own readme within, so feel free to extract/read just what you want, or download the entire archive.

Happy coding!
